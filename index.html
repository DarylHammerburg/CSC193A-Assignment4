  <h1>Valve's Source engine</h1>
    <p>
	<strong>Source</strong> is a 3D game engine developed by Valve designed to provide developers with the most torturous experience possible.<br>
	Source is a successor to the somehow even more unintuitive to use <strong>GoldSrc</strong> engine from 2004.<br>
	Source has been used in many titles such as Half-Life:Source, Counter-Strike:Source, and Half-Life 2<br>
	<br>
	You have to use at least <strong>four</strong> separate pieces of software in order to successfully port a 3D model into source,<br>
	and may god have mercy on your soul if you want to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_water_torture">bake a lightmap onto a translucent texture</a>.<br>
